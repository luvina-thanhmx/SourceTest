** Download **

All binaries are available from:
- http://www.edgytech.com/umongo

** Install and Run **

Windows:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract All”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo (type Application)

Linux:

- place archive file where is preferred (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (right-click “Extract Here”)
- open the extracted folder and double-click launch-umongo.sh, or execute launch-umongo.sh in a terminal

Mac OSX:

- place archive file where is preferred and extract it (for example, in your downloads folder)
- extract the archive (double-click the file)
- open the extracted folder and double-click umongo.app

If your Mac tells you that the application is damaged, you can try a few things:

- go to "system preferences / security and privacy / General"
Make sure that "allow applications downloaded from" is set to "anywhere".

- It could also be that you have a case-sensitive file system.
Run "diskutil list /" from the command line and see if it says case-sensitive.

One workaround is to right-click on the file, select Show Package Contents, then go to Contents -> Resources -> Java.
Then, just open using jar. You can make an alias to this for easy access if you want.

** Using a Proxy **

Often times your client machine cannot directly connect to the MongoDB hosts.
One easy trick is to use a SOCKS proxy based on SSH tunnel to connect transparently:
$ ssh -D 9000 -i key.pem hostThatCanConnectToDB -N

Then make sure you select a SOCKS proxy of "localhost:9000" in the connection settings.

** Building UMongo **

To compile:
- run "ant jar" from the base directory

To package the application:
- go to the "package" folder and run "./package.sh"
